# üìö Project Methodology: Security Operation Center (SOC)

This document outlines the methodology used in the design and development of a Security Operation Center (SOC) as part of a final diploma project.

## üîç 1. Project Scope

The main objective was to simulate the planning and setup of a SOC for a mid-sized organization. The project focused on log collection, threat monitoring, security event correlation, and building a foundational understanding of SOC operations using real tools.

## üß© 2. Key Components of the SOC

- **SIEM (Splunk Enterprise):** Central platform for log collection, event correlation, dashboarding, and alerting.
- **Windows Server 2022:** Used to simulate Active Directory and provide logs as a Windows-based source.
- **Ubuntu Linux VM:** Simulated Linux-based log source.
- **Huawei USG6000 Firewall:** Used for traffic control and perimeter security, generating firewall logs.
- **PuTTY & WinSCP:** Tools for remote access and secure file transfers between systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è 3. Implementation Steps

1. **Design SOC Architecture:**
   - Defined data flow between endpoints, firewall, and the SIEM.
   - Created architecture diagrams to visualize system relationships.

2. **Log Collection:**
   - Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder on Windows and Linux VMs.
   - Configured log sources including system logs, firewall logs, and authentication logs.

3. **Splunk Setup:**
   - Installed Splunk Enterprise on a dedicated server.
   - Configured data inputs and created custom dashboards for event visibility.
   - Applied correlation searches to detect suspicious behavior.

4. **Firewall Integration:**
   - Connected Huawei firewall to send logs to Splunk via syslog.
   - Created filtering rules and monitored allowed/denied traffic.

5. **Threat Simulation:**
   - Simulated login attempts, port scans, and file transfers to test detection capabilities.
   - Verified that alerts were triggered and visualized in Splunk dashboards.

## üß† 4. Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with SIEM configuration and log analysis.
- Learned to build SOC workflows and architecture from scratch.
- Understood the role of each SOC component in threat detection and response.

## üìå Summary

This methodology demonstrates how a functional SOC can be simulated in a lab environment using enterprise-grade tools. The project focused on architecture, log integration, and threat visibility to build foundational knowledge for real-world SOC operations.
