# 🛡️ Design and Development of the Security Operation Center (SOC) Project

This repository contains the final diploma project focused on designing and developing a **Security Operation Center (SOC)**. The project includes threat monitoring methodology, SIEM system implementation, and a full SOC architecture designed for a simulated enterprise environment.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To research, design, and simulate a functioning SOC using enterprise-grade tools. The goal was to understand how modern SOCs operate, integrate technologies like SIEM and firewalls, and define workflows for incident monitoring and response.

## 🧰 Technologies and Tools Used

- **Splunk Enterprise** — Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Windows Server 2022** — Log source and domain environment
- **Huawei USG6000 Firewall** — Network perimeter protection and traffic control
- **Windows & Ubuntu VMs** — Log sources and simulation targets
- **PuTTY** — Secure shell access (SSH) to Linux systems
- **WinSCP** — Secure file transfer between Windows and Linux

## 🧪 Project Methodology

- Defined the roles and structure of a SOC
- Collected logs from multiple systems using Splunk forwarders
- Configured firewall rules and simulated network events
- Designed SOC infrastructure (including SIEM, log flow, and firewall interaction)
- Created dashboards, detection rules, and alerting workflows in Splunk
- Presented and documented the complete system as part of the diploma defense

## 📌 Key Results

- SOC architecture designed using real enterprise tools
- Working integration of Splunk with Windows and Linux environments
- Simulated threat events and response scenarios
- Formal presentation and report delivered for academic evaluation
